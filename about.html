                                    I am an Information Technology student who is curious about learning and exploring technology. 
                                    My journey in web development began with HTML and CSS, and I am gradually building my skills 
                                    in programming and software development.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As I continue my studies, I am gaining basic knowledge in different programming languages. 
                                    I enjoy learning step by step and practicing what I learn through simple projects and hands-on experience.

                                <p>
                                    I am currently studying at the University of Mindanao, where I am learning different areas 
                                    of Information Technology such as web development, database basics, and programming fundamentals.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Through my school projects, I have practiced building simple web pages and forms, 
                                    worked with basic databases, and used Python to connect with and manage data in small applications 
                                    like a library information system. These experiences are helping me gradually improve my skills 
                                    and gain confidence step by step.

                                <p>
                                    I believe that working with discipline and patience helps build lasting learning. 
                                    Trying things out, even through trial and error, gives me knowledge that I can use to grow. 
                                    My goal is not just to finish this course, but to learn as much as I can along the way.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I am focused on improving step by step, learning new technologies, 
                                    and slowly building experience through my studies and small projects.

                                <p>
                                    My aspiration is to become a skilled web developer who can create simple, user-friendly, 
                                    and practical web applications. I am still at the early stages of learning, but I enjoy 
                                    exploring how websites are built and how different technologies work together. 
                                    Step by step, I want to improve my skills in HTML, CSS, Python, databases and etc.., while also 
                                    learning how to make projects more responsive and useful for everyday needs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I hope to gain more experience by working on small projects, practicing through trial and error, 
                                    and gradually building confidence in my abilities. My goal is not only to finish my studies, 
                                    but also to apply what I learn in real situations, whether through academic projects or personal practice. 
                                    In the future, I would like to contribute to the technology industry in my own way, even if it starts 
                                    with small but meaningful projects that can help people and communities.
